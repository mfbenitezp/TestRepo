# Python for Geospatial Analysis

**By [Tomas Beuzen](https://www.tomasbeuzen.com/) ðŸš€**

Welcome to Python for Geospatial Analysis! With this [website](https://www.tomasbeuzen.com/python-for-geospatial-analysis/) I aim to provide a crashcourse introduction to using Python to wrangle, plot, and model geospatial data. We'll be using libraries such as `geopandas`, `plotly`, `keplergl`, and `pykrige` to these ends.

## Getting Started

The material on this site is written in Jupyter notebooks and rendered using [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html). However, if you wish to run these notebooks on your local machine, you can do the following:

1. Clone the GitHub repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/TomasBeuzen/python-for-geospatial-analysis.git
   ```
2. Install the conda environment by typing the following in your terminal:
   ```sh
   conda env create -f py4gs.yaml
   ```
3. Open the course in JupyterLab by typing the following in your terminal:
   ```sh
   cd python-for-geospatial-analysis
   jupyterlab
   ```

```{note}
If you're not comfortable with `git`, `GitHub` or `conda`, feel free to just read through the material on this website - you're not missing out on anything!
